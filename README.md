# Climate Change through Temperature Trends
Analyzing temperature trends and its implications for climate science, policy-making, and environmental sustainability

## Getting Started: 
1. Report and presentation
2. data/: Contains cleaned datasets used for the analysis
3. notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks
4. visualizations/: Tableau visualizations and dashboard
5. scripts/: Python and SQL scripts for data analysis

### Tools:
Excel, Jupyter, Python, SQL, Tableau

### Data Sources:
The temperature data is sourced from reputable climate monitoring agencies and research institutions, ensuring its reliability and accuracy.

The analysis will be based on the cleaned dataset, which includes the following fields:
* Country: The name of the country.
* Country ID: The ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code.
* Year: The year of the temperature record.
* Temperature: The annual surface temperature (in degrees Celsius) for the corresponding year and country.

## Problem Definition
In recent decades, concerns about climate change have intensified as scientific evidence increasingly points to human activities as significant contributors to global warming. Understanding temperature trends is crucial for assessing the magnitude and pace of climate change and its potential consequences on ecosystems, economies, and societies worldwide.

## Hypothesis
Long-term analysis of temperature trends will reveal statistically significant patterns indicating global warming trends across multiple countries over the years.

## Vision
Leverage data-driven insights to deepen our understanding of climate dynamics and contribute to the collective efforts aimed at addressing climate change challenges. By analyzing temperature trends over time, the report aims to uncover meaningful patterns and trends that can inform policy-making, advance scientific research, and promote public awareness and engagement on climate-related issues.

## Objective
* Analyze temperature trends over time to understand the extent and nature of climate change impacts across different countries.
* Examine long-term temperature data, to elucidate patterns, trends, and variations that may indicate global warming, regional climate shifts, or other significant environmental changes.
* Generate actionable insights that can inform policy decisions, guide adaptation strategies, and contribute to global efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change.

## Key Insights
### Dashboard

## Next Steps
* Use the insights from temperature trend analysis to promote adaptive strategies and resilience-building measures. These measures will help mitigate the impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities and ecosystems.
* Leverage the findings to advocate for increased investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, disaster preparedness, and ecosystem restoration. These investments are crucial for enhancing adaptive capacity and reducing climate-related risks.
* Highlight the importance of international cooperation and climate diplomacy based on the analysis. Collaborative efforts are essential to effectively address global climate challenges and implement sustainable solutions.
