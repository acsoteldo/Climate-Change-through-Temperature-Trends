# Climate Change through Temperature Trends
Analyzing temperature trends and its implications for climate science, policy-making, and environmental sustainability

## Getting Started: 
1. Report and presentation
2. data/: Contains cleaned datasets used for the analysis
3. notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks
4. visualizations/: Tableau visualizations and dashboard
5. scripts/: Python and SQL scripts for data analysis

### Tools:
Excel, Jupyter, Python, SQL, Tableau

### Data Sources:
The temperature data is sourced from reputable climate monitoring agencies and research institutions, ensuring its reliability and accuracy.

The analysis will be based on the cleaned dataset, which includes the following fields:
* Country: The name of the country.
* Country ID: The ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code.
* Year: The year of the temperature record.
* Temperature: The annual surface temperature (in degrees Celsius) for the corresponding year and country.

## Problem Definition
In recent decades, concerns about climate change have intensified as scientific evidence increasingly points to human activities as significant contributors to global warming. Understanding temperature trends is crucial for assessing the magnitude and pace of climate change and its potential consequences on ecosystems, economies, and societies worldwide.

## Hypothesis
Long-term analysis of temperature trends will reveal statistically significant patterns indicating global warming trends across multiple countries over the years.

## Vision
Leverage data-driven insights to deepen our understanding of climate dynamics and contribute to the collective efforts aimed at addressing climate change challenges. By analyzing temperature trends over time, the report aims to uncover meaningful patterns and trends that can inform policy-making, advance scientific research, and promote public awareness and engagement on climate-related issues.

## Objective
* Evaluate the yearly temperature variations across countries in 2022 to assess regional climate patterns and variations.
* Compare yearly temperature variations across countries in 2000 with more recent data (2022) to analyze changes over time.
* Identify and rank countries with the highest increase in temperatures over the specified period (2000 to 2022).

## Key Insights
* Temperatures have been steadily increasing over the years globally.
* Notably, Scandinavian countries and other northern hemisphere nations have experienced the highest temperature increases.
* The dataset lacks information from some countries, such as Russia.
* The dataset spans from 1961 to 2022, with data collected in three-year intervals.

## Next Steps
* Use the insights from temperature trend analysis to promote adaptive strategies and resilience-building measures. These measures will help mitigate the impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities and ecosystems.
* Leverage the findings to advocate for increased investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, disaster preparedness, and ecosystem restoration. These investments are crucial for enhancing adaptive capacity and reducing climate-related risks.
* Highlight the importance of international cooperation and climate diplomacy based on the analysis. Collaborative efforts are essential to effectively address global climate challenges and implement sustainable solutions.
